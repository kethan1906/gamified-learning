# 🎓 BTR Bites — Gamified Learning Platform

> **🏆 Hackathon Winner** — A concept-stage gamified learning platform built for students preparing for competitive exams like NEET, JEE, and more.

---

## 📖 About the Project

**BTR Bites** (also known as **Quiz Quest**) is an interactive, gamified educational web app designed to make exam preparation fun and engaging. Students can explore subjects, tackle chapter-wise quizzes, earn XP, level up, and compete on a global leaderboard — all while playing mini-games between study sessions.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project was built as a proof-of-concept during a hackathon. Core features are scaffolded and functional on the frontend; backend integration and full data persistence are not yet implemented.
